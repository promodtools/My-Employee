    <div class="section">
        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the <strong>My Employee Management System</strong> application ("we", "us", or "our") handles your data. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. By using the app, you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Local Data Storage</h2>
        <p>The app operates primarily as an "offline-first" application. This means that all data you enter—including employee details, attendance records, advances, and payroll information—is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>. We do not collect, transmit, or store this data on our own external servers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Google Drive Backup and Sync</h2>
        <p>We offer a premium feature allowing you to back up your data to your personal Google Drive account. If you enable this feature:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> You will be asked to sign in using your Google account.</li>
            <li><strong>Access Scope:</strong> The app requests permission only to view and manage the specific files and folders it creates (e.g., the `MyEmployee` backup folder). It cannot read or modify your other personal files on Google Drive.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Privacy:</strong> We do not have access to your Google Drive account, nor do we share your synced data with any third parties. Your data remains strictly between your device and your Google account.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>The app offers premium features (such as PDF exports and Google Cloud Sync) through in-app purchases. All payment processing is securely handled by the <strong>Google Play Store</strong>. We do not collect, process, or store your credit card information, billing address, or any other financial details.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Permissions Used by the App</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Storage/Files:</strong> Required to save PDF reports (Payslips and Attendance) and local backup files directly to your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Internet Access:</strong> Required for syncing backups with Google Drive and validating in-app purchases.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>Because the app does not send your core business data to our servers, we have no personal data to share, sell, or disclose to third parties.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>6. Security</h2>
        <p>We value your trust in our app. Since your data is primarily stored locally, the security of that data relies heavily on the security of your device. We recommend using device-level security features (such as PINs or biometrics) to protect your information.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at <strong>[janitha877@mail.com]</strong>.</p>
